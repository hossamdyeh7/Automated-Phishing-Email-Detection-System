Developed an automated phishing detection system using a RoBERTa-based model to classify emails as malicious or legitimate. The system includes a VirusTotal link scanner to check URLs in emails against threat-intelligence feeds, and an additional defense-in-depth keyword layer that flags emails as malicious if suspicious keywords are found — serving as an extra verification step for borderline or unknown cases. Designed for real-time email analysis, it combines machine learning, threat intelligence, and heuristic rules to improve detection accuracy and reduce false negatives.
